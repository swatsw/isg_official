 I would like to have the opportunity to write something original and different Something that would appeal to a different crowd .
 I would like to have a regular job like , like I don't know I'd be working every day just like going like , okay I'm nearly there I'm at the top of my game I could like just go on for ages like that's what I would do .
 And then like I woke up the next day and I was like oh , okay Like that's that's actually happened Like that's definitely a thing that's happening .
 one thing that surprised me was the lack of social anxiety There's like , quite a few people that I know that have like , low to moderate social anxiety but it's never anything like .
 And like there's this one guy that I know that's about to , get like , kicked off the island for like no reason .
 There's one guy that seems really bothered by the fact that he's like , not the nicest person but I think he's just like really kind of Has trouble with the conversation because the conversation is always like , struggling .
 I grew up with a certain political environment like like I grew up with very Like political awareness like like I didn't grow up with , the kind of intellectual honesty that lots of people my age do .
 One thing that surprised me was the lack of like Sarcasm in there Like there's not a single joke that isn't a little bit sarcastic It's not a lot , like but it's still there .
 I'm not sure if I want to talk about it Um , But anyway yeah So like I started getting all geeked out about like I don't know man this is gonna be really fun .
 The thing is is that like it's such an individual thing , like I don't know like I was like I wanted to write a love story .
 without trying to be too technical like I mean , I don't know , it's just the way it is I guess You know , like it's technical so I might as well , but like .
 Um yeah so I started going to the gym seriously trying to lose weight there like last year And I started getting really into weightlifting and things like that .
 It's interesting because like there's very clearly a hierarchy Like you know people like her like I mean I don't know like she's spoken at some really fancy things like this year .
 It means that like , in the long run it kind of debunks a lot of the stuff that people are saying like like oh it's just me being dramatic Anyway .
 No matter how hard you work or how well you pray or whatever you have to do you're never going to be as powerful as you want to be because You know that feeling where you just like .
 I really wish you would have told me that earlier Um I would have figured it out much earlier but no I'm very good at categorizing .
 Um Like I've been told I've talked about already having a thing like with with magic systems and things like that and like I don't know like there's uh with Dungeons and Dragons and like .
